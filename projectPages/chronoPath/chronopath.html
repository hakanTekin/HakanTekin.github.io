                        ChronoPath is an endless side-scroller in which you can control time 
                        to manupilate the world objects. The goal of the game is to go 
                        as far as you can until the sun goes down. The objects (called obstacles) 
                        are created randomly and they are the combination of different attributes.
                    </p>

                        I did not have any experience with Unity3D before. This project helped me learn more about both game development and Unity3D itself.
                        In ChronoPath, I used multiple design patterns (explained in <b>Technical Bits</b> section) and got some experience on how to effectively use them.

                There are 4 important classes worth mentioning in the game.

                    <h3>World</h3>

                    <div>
                        World in ChronoPath controls the chunks(pieces of the world) and the time.
                        <br>
                        Operations world is responsible for handling:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Deciding when and where to create new chunks</li>
                            <li>Spawning chunks and their contents</li>
                            <li>Destroying chunks if they are no longer needed</li>
                            <li>Calculating the new chunk positions when the player moves</li>
                            <li>Moving and adjusting background items(sun and sky)</li>
                            <li>Ending the game</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        Time normally progresses at fixed intervals by using coroutines. 
                        But the player can manipulate world time by using the slider(explained in <b>Character</b>). 
                        <br>
                        The character's horizontal position is fixed in ChronoPath, instead of moving the character forward
                        <b>The world moves backward.</b>
                        When the player is nearing end of existing chunks, new obstacles 
                        have to be created for keeping the game going. When this happens, World informs the 
                        <b>chunk factory</b> for a new one. After a chunk is created, <b>Obstacle Factory</b> is used for populating the chunk.
                        <p>Below, you can find the code for these operations.</p>

                    <h3>Obstacles</h3>
                    <div>
                        Obstacles are created randomly, and they can have multiple attributes. These attributes are randomly assigned to an obstacle during runtime (when they are being created).
                        To be able to assign random combinations of attributes, the <b>Decorator Pattern</b> was used.
                        <br>
                        The attributes (or decorations) developed are as follows:
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Blipping</b></li>
                            Blipping obstacles will appear/disappear in fixed intervals starting from time-0.
                            <br>
                            If a blipper has an interval of 10. Then at time-10x it will disappear, and appear in time-10x+10
                            <li><b>Delayed</b></li>
                            Delayed attribute is used to enhance blipping obstacles. Obstacles with this attribute will not start blipping from the beginning, but at a later time that is randomly selected.
                            <li><b>Fading</b></li>
                            Fading attribute shortens the existence time of an obstacle. Normally the obstacles will be active form start to finish. 
                            Obstacles with fading decoration will be activated at a random time and they will deactivate in another.
                            <li><b>Dynamic</b></li>
                            Obstacles with Dynamic decoration will move back and forth in a randomly selected range.
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                </section>

                <section class="subsection" id="CharacterSection">

                    <h3>Character</h3>
                    <div>
                        <p>
                        The character is controlled with a d-pad placed to the left of the screen. It allows the user to go left-right, jump and crouch. In the right side of the screen, there are two UI elements.
                        The time slider and attack button. 
                        </p>
                        Time Slider is used for manupilating world time to create an empty path blocked by various obstacles. 
                        Users can only change time by a limited amount, so they have to use this tool carefully. 
                        <p>The attack button is used to make a slash attack. This can destroy obstacles in short range, opening the pathway. 
                        But the attack increases world time therefore bringing the player close to nightfall.
                        </p>
