                    Vladimir Mariovsky is my first attempt at creating a video game. 
                    Made during my sophomore (2nd) year in college for a course. It takes 
                    inspiration from the classic Mario games. The goal is to reach the end of the map
                    and touch the pole.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    The game has simple enemies that travel back and forth, player can either jump on top of them 
                    or hit them with the vodka bottle shards. The shards are obtained by finding the vodka bottles, 
                    when mariovsky gets the bottle he smashes it to small shards that can be thrown.
