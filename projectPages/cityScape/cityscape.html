            <p>
                CityScape is a 3D Action/Adventure game made with UnrealEngine 4.
                The goal of CityScape is to collect the hidden packages and escape from 
                the city.
                While you are searching the city, beware of the enemies out to get you,
                they are heavily armed and can put you down fairly easily.

                The fixer(you) has abilities that will be useful in your adventure.

                <h3>World</h3>
                <p>
                    There are several maps in CityScape and the default map is 
                    <b>The City</b>.
                    This map uses an asset pack found in UnrealEngine Marketplace (link can 
                    be found in GitHub
                    Repostiory Readme file). 
                    2 types of Package are spawned randomly in the map when the game starts.
                    The fake packages will explode when interacted with,
                    while the real ones increase the package counter (that is part of the UI).
                </p>

            <section class="subsection" id="EnemiesSection">
                <h3>Enemies</h3>
                <p>
                    Enemies are created by <b>Patrol Points</b> that are placed in the city.
                    When an enemy is created, it searches for the nearest patrol point and 
                    moves to it.
                    After waiting for a variable amount of time, it searches for the next 
                    nearest patrol point that is
                    available.
                    With this algorithm, enemies are distributed evenly among the map for a 
                    better experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A simple AI is made using the <b>Behaviour Trees</b> of UnrealEngine 4.
                    The AI supports basic functionalities such as navigation, searching for 
                    enemies and atackking.

            <section class="subsection" id="CharacterSection">
                <h3>Character</h3>
                Player character is called <b>The Fixer</b> and it has 3 main abilities.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Grappling Hook
                    </li>
                    <p>
                        Grappling Hook is useful for traversing the city quickly. It can attach to any surface. 
                        The player can swing around or pull itself to the snapping point with high velocity.
                        <br>
                        The pull ability has a cooldown, so it cannot be spammed for any purpose.
                    </p>
                    <li>
                        Revolver
                    </li>
                    <p>
                        The player has a revolver that contains very limited ammo, 
                        it is a last resort option for taking out enemies.
                    </p>
                    <li>
                        Wall Dash
                        <p>
                            When the fixer can use vertical surfaces to pull itself upwards repeatedly. This way it can scale buildings or other entities without needing to use the Grappling Hook. 
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
