                    CityScape is a 3D Action/Adventure game made with UnrealEngine 4. 
                    The goal of CityScape is to collect the hidden packages and escape from the city.
                    While you are searching the city, beware of the enemies out to get you, 
                    they are heavily armed and can put you down fairly easily.

                    The fixer(you) has abilities that will be useful in your adventure.

                    <p>
                        There are several maps in CityScape and the default map is <b>The City</b>. 
                        This map uses an asset pack found in UnrealEngine Marketplace (link can be found in GitHub Repostiory Readme file).                         
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        2 types of Package are spawned randomly in the map when the game starts. 
                        The fake packages will explode when interacted with, 
                        while the real ones increase the package counter (that is part of the UI).
                    </p>

                    <h3>Enemies</h3>
                    <p>
                        Enemies are created by <b>Patrol Points</b> that are placed in the city. 
                        When an enemy is created, it searches for the nearest patrol point and moves to it.
                        After waiting for a variable amount of time, it searches for the next nearest patrol point that is available.
                        With this algorithm, enemies are distributed evenly among the map for a better experience.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A simple AI is made using the <b>Behaviour Trees</b> of UnrealEngine 4. 
                        The AI supports basic functionalities such as navigation, searching for enemies and atackking.
